The smart home project employing ESP32 and the Blynk app enables remote control of home appliances through a Wi-Fi connection. The system utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller as the central processing unit and Blynk platform as the control interface through a mobile application. Users can remotely manage various home appliances such as lights, fans, switches, and more, using the Blynk app installed on their smartphones. The ESP32 connects to the home Wi-Fi network, establishing a communication link with the Blynk server to receive commands from the user's mobile device. Through the Blynk app's intuitive interface, users can toggle appliance states, set schedules for automation, monitor power consumption, and receive real-time status updates of the connected devices. This setup provides convenience, energy efficiency, and enhanced control over home appliances, offering users the flexibility to manage their home environment remotely and intelligently.
Also Measures Power Consumption and uses a 16x2 LCD to display the metrics
